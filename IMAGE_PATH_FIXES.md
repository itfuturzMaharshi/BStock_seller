# Image Path Fixes - BStock Seller Project

## Problem
The application was getting 404 errors for image resources because the image paths were not correctly configured for the Vite base path.

## Root Cause
The Vite configuration has `base: '/seller/'` which means all static assets need to be prefixed with `/seller/`. However, the image references in the code were using `/images/...` instead of `/seller/images/...`.

## Files Fixed

### 1. Product Images
**File:** `src/components/ecommerce/RecentOrders.tsx`
- Fixed 5 product image paths:
  - `product-01.jpg` → `/seller/images/product/product-01.jpg`
  - `product-02.jpg` → `/seller/images/product/product-02.jpg`
  - `product-03.jpg` → `/seller/images/product/product-03.jpg`
  - `product-04.jpg` → `/seller/images/product/product-04.jpg`
  - `product-05.jpg` → `/seller/images/product/product-05.jpg`

### 2. Grid Shape Images
**File:** `src/components/common/GridShape.tsx`
- Fixed 2 grid shape image paths:
  - `grid-01.svg` → `/seller/images/shape/grid-01.svg`

### 3. User Avatar Images
**File:** `src/pages/UiElements/Avatars.tsx`
- Fixed 20+ user avatar image paths:
  - All `/images/user/` → `/seller/images/user/`

### 4. Error Page Images
**File:** `src/pages/OtherPage/NotFound.tsx`
- Fixed error page image paths:
  - `404.svg` → `/seller/images/error/404.svg`
  - `404-dark.svg` → `/seller/images/error/404-dark.svg`

### 5. Grid Image Components
**Files:** 
- `src/components/ui/images/TwoColumnImageGrid.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/images/ThreeColumnImageGrid.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/images/ResponsiveImage.tsx`

Fixed grid image paths:
- All `/images/grid-image/` → `/seller/images/grid-image/`

### 6. Notification Dropdown Images
**File:** `src/components/header/NotificationDropdown.tsx`
- Fixed 8 notification user avatar paths:
  - All `/images/user/` → `/seller/images/user/`

### 7. Table Images
**File:** `src/components/tables/BasicTables/BasicTableOne.tsx`
- Fixed 16 table user avatar paths:
  - All `/images/user/` → `/seller/images/user/`

## Solution Applied
All image references were updated from `/images/...` to `/seller/images/...` to match the Vite base path configuration.

## Result
- ✅ All 404 errors for images should now be resolved
- ✅ Images will load correctly with the proper base path
- ✅ No linting errors introduced
- ✅ All image references are now consistent

## Verification
After these changes, the following images should load correctly:
- Product images (product-01.jpg through product-05.jpg)
- Grid shape (grid-01.svg)
- User avatars (user-01.jpg through user-33.jpg)
- Error page images (404.svg, 404-dark.svg)
- Grid images (image-01.png through image-06.png)
